# strava-api-extension
extension that connects to strava stats and connects users with similar paces and race goals with a personalized training plan.

Strava API Integration

Use the Strava API to retrieve relevant user data:
Running stats: Average pace, distances, elevation gains, etc. (via /athlete/stats and /activities endpoints).
Activity history: Analyze recent runs to determine fitness level.
Heart rate/power zones: For advanced users who track these metrics.
Authenticate users via OAuth 2.0 to access their Strava data securely.
User Registration for Races

Allow users to manually select or search for races they are participating in.
Integrate race databases via APIs (e.g., Athlinks or external race directories) or allow users to input race details.
Match users participating in the same race based on:
Average pace, weekly mileage, or similar training patterns.
Location proximity (if they want in-person meetups for training).
Personalized Training Plan Generation

Build training plans using:
Race type and date: Marathon, half-marathon, 5K, etc., and remaining training weeks.
User stats: Average pace, long-run distance, and current fitness level.
Training frameworks: Use established methodologies (e.g., Jack Daniels, Hal Higdon) to provide structured plans.
Add dynamic adjustments:
Track users’ progress and adapt the plan weekly based on completed activities.
Connecting Users

Create groups of users with similar stats:
Match based on pace, mileage, and goals (e.g., “Finish under 4 hours” for a marathon).
Use group chats or integration with platforms like Slack, WhatsApp, or Discord for communication.
Suggest local meetups or virtual runs.
Allow users to follow each other on Strava.
Engagement Features

Track progress and provide race day recommendations (e.g., pacing strategy, nutrition tips).
Offer badges or challenges for milestones (e.g., “Longest Run Week” or “Fastest Tempo”).

Authenticate and Fetch Data:

Use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and fetch stats.
API Endpoints:
/athlete: Basic user profile (e.g., name, location).
/activities: Detailed activity logs, including pace, distance, heart rate, etc.
/segments: Identify nearby training routes or compare efforts on shared segments.
Process and Analyze Data:

Store user stats in a database (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL).
Use algorithms to:
Cluster users with similar paces/stats (e.g., k-means clustering).
Generate personalized plans (e.g., use predefined templates and adjust based on fitness level).
UI/UX:

Design a user-friendly interface to:
Input race details.
Visualize training plans and group matches.
Provide progress tracking and stats comparison.
Deployment:

Backend: Use Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js for API calls and data processing.
Frontend: Build a web app (React/Vue) or mobile app (Flutter/React Native).
Hosting: Deploy on AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
